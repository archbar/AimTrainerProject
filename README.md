Aim Trainer Project
Overview

The Aim Trainer Project is a first-person target training game built in Unity. The main goal of this project is to implement complex target behaviors, simulate realistic shooting mechanics, and provide an interactive environment for players to improve their aiming skills. The project emphasizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including inheritance and polymorphism, as well as practical experience using Unity for game development.

Learning Objectives

Through this project, I have focused on:

Implementing OOP concepts in Unity, particularly for guns and target behaviors.

Creating complex algorithms to manage target movement, spawning, and scoring.

Designing flexible and reusable code using class hierarchies, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Learning Unity workflows, including project structure, prefabs, scripts, and UI design.

The main takeaway from this project has been understanding how to structure code for scalability and maintainability in a game context, as well as gaining experience with Unity’s development environment. I primarily began this project for my NEA, and I have found it to be a valuable experience, gaining many skills I have used during university, including soft skills such as time management.
